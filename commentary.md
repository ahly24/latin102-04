## Option B
Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illustration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginus’ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

In Hercules fourth labor, he was ordered to bring a boar back to Eurystheus alive. In the vase, we see a figure carrying a boar seemingly trying to trap it with help from another person. However, Hercules was said to kill it in the sentence.




### Hyginus, Chapter 30 Section 13

*canem Cerberum Typhonis filium ab inferis regi in conspectum adduxit* 

Louvre F 204
Side A: Kerberos

Hercules is taking Cerebus and bringing him back from the underworld in his final, twelfth labor. The vase displays a two-headed hound instead of three. It is similar in showing that Hercules was attempting to lure Cerebus out.
