(From Hyginus, chapter 34.)

Highlighting **like this** indicates words or phrases referred to in the following grammatical questions.

Deianira, uxor Herculis, flumen magnum, **cui** nomen Evenus erat, non poterat **transire**, et centaurum Nessum, qui filius Ixionis et Nubis erat, auxilium rogavit. Hic Deianiram **sublatam** in flumine ipso uiolare uoluit. huc Hercules cum interuenisset et Deianira cum fidem eius implorasset, Nessum **sagittis** confixit.

ille **moriens**, cum sciret sagittas Hydrae Lernaeae **felle tinctas** magnam vim habere, sanguinem suum **exceptum** Deianirae dedit et id philtrum esse dixit.

## A. Grammatical analysis
Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

Deianira, uxor Herculis, flumen magnum

> cui nomen Evenus erat

non *poterat transire* 

et

centaurum Nessum 

> qui filius Ixonis et Nubis *erat*

auxilium *rogavit*

Hic Deianiram 
> *sublatam* in flumine ipso 

uiolare *voluit.*

Huc Hercules

> cum *interuenisset*

> et Deianira cum fidem eius *implorasset,*

Nessum sagittis *confixit.*

Ille

> *moriens,*

> cum *sciret*

>> sagittas

>>> Hydrae Lernaeae felle tinctas

>> magnam vim *habere,* 

sanguinem suum 
>> exceptum 
Deianirae *dedit*

et

> id *philtrum* esse

*dixit.*

## B. Grammatical questions
1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
- flumen, neuter, singular. Cui is dative and acts as an indirect object‚ùå in the relative clause, this case is due to the indirect object. 
- *Cui is dative due to the dative of possession.* 

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
- present active infinitive. I placed it in the clause I chose because the action was unable to be done. 

3. sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense, voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short‚Äôs Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.
- feminine, accusative, singular, perfect, passive

4. Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?
- feminine, dative, plural. Hyginus uses this case because it rep

5. Identify the form of moriens.
- neuter, nominative, singular, present, active‚ùå 
- *masculine, nominative, singular, present, active*

6. Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?
- neuter, ablative, singular. Hyginus uses this case because it explains the prepositional phrase‚ùå of the arrows dyed with poison. 
- *Felle is ablative due to the ablative of means.*

7. Identify the form of tinctas.
- feminine, accusative, plural, perfect, passive

8. Identify the form of exceptum.
- neuter, nominative, singular, perfect, passive

9. William Faulkner‚Äôs novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner‚Äôs title into Latin.
- moriens

## C. Translation
Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was unable to cross the large river, which was named Evenus, 
and the centaur Nessus, whose sons were Ixion and Nubes, asked to help‚ùå. (*and asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, for help*).

Here he lifted Deianira himself in the river and wished to violate her.

When Hercules intervened and when Deianira begged his faithü§î (*begged with tears for help*), he pierced Nessus with arrows.

As he was dying, 
he knew the arrows were dyed with the poision of the Lernaean Hydra so that they hold great power, ‚ùå (*when he knew that Hydra Lernaean's arrows were soaked in the potent poison*), he gave his blood to Deianira and she accepted and he said there exists a love potion. ‚ùå (*he gave Deianira his blood and told her it was a love potion*).
