# Translation 3: Three labors of Hercules

## Glossary and notes
Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

## Vocabulary:

- Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
- bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
- caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
- Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
- purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
- quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
- stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

## Passage to analyze
Hyginus, chapter 30, sections 7-9.

7 Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die purgavit, maiorem partem Iove adiutore; flumine admisso totum stercus abluit.

8 taurum cum quo Pasiphae concubuit ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum adduxit.

9 Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana vescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

## A. Grammatical analysis 

Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die *purgavit*,

maiorem partem 
> Iove adiutore;

> flumine admisso

totum stercus *abluit*.

Taurum
> cum quo Pasiphae *concubuit*

ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum *adduxit*.

Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius,
> qui carne humana *vescebantur*,

cum Abdero famulo *interfecit*;

equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

## B. Grammatical questions
1. In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase?
Iove is the ablative case. This phrase is an ablative absolute construction because the noun and pronoun agree in participle and defines a circumstance.
3. What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?
Stercus is in the nominative case because it is the subject of the predicate subject relation, stercus abluit.❌ 
*Stercus is in the accusative case because it has two direct objects.**
5. Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).
Maiorem is masculine/feminine accusative singular comparative.
6. Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.
Flumine admisso takes on the construction ablative of means in order to be expressed as an ablative without a preposition. 
7. What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?
Qui is masculine plural nominative and its antecedent is "equos" of "equos quattuor euis."
8. What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?
The gerund has to be understood because the verb "nomina" is being used as a noun.

## C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

1. *Maiorem partem* is used by Hyginus in order to enhance the idea that Hercules had to clean a big amount of the manure and stall. Hercules had done a "greater part" of it with help. Hyginus had also removed Hercules as the subject and added an object along with including Jupiter, who had helped Hercules.
2. *Creta insula* is an example of a hyperbaton because it is a noun adjective relation. The relation enhances the sentence because it switches the proper order of noun-adjective "for poetic effect" (*Wikipedia*). *Creta* is the adjective and *insula* is the noun so it would generally be *insula creta.* I briefly learned about this word in philosophy because Plato had described it to be an inversion of natural word order❗️ **Nice!**
